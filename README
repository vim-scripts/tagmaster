Tagmaster is a plugin aimed for easy operating with tags and tag files. It allows generating tags for current project or file, deleting tags for given file, updating tags, etc.
Tags file name can be either specified explicitly, or deduced. Any tag file (found with tagfiles() function) is checked for if it can belong to current project (placed at the same directory level, or several levels up).
Before updating tags for given file, they all are deleted first to avoid duplicate tags.
When generating tags for project, current filetype is considered and only files of this filetype are scanned. This is done to avoid collecting garbage from auxiliary files like config scripts, Makefiles, etc.

NOTE: This plugin supports only exuberant ctags version. You should have it in your PATH environment.
